# Candy-Crash-By-Terminal

This was my first personal project, developed for the *Object-Oriented Programming* exam at Univaq.  
⚠️ The project is entirely in Italian and features only a **text-based interface** running in the terminal.

## Requirements
- A Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your computer (Java 8 or higher recommended).

## How to Run

First, clone the repository and move into the project directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Puaison/Candy-Crash-Terminal.git
cd Candy-Crash-Terminal
```
Then, compile all the classes:
```bash
cd code
javac -source 1.8 -target 1.8 *.java
```
Finally, run the program:
```bash
java ProgettoOggetti2019
```
